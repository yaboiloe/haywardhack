    <h2>Introduction<br>What is aquaponics?…a resilient farming system that provides wellness and better nutrition.

     <h2>Aquaponics is a sustainable method of raising both fish and vegetables. It is popular with individuals, entrepreneurs, educators, missions and governments.  Furthermore, with this type of indoor farming, you grow substantially more food with less water, land and labor than traditional agriculture.</h2>

    <h2>Aquaponics is a form of agriculture that combines raising fish in tanks (recirculating aquaculture) with soilless plant culture (hydroponics).  In aquaponics, the nutrient-rich water from raising fish provides a natural fertilizer for the plants and the plants help to purify the water for the fish.  Aquaponics can be used to sustainably raise fresh fish and vegetables for a family, to feed a village or to generate profit in a commercial farming venture, year ‘round, in any climate.</h2>

    <h2>Aquaponics is a great example of year ’round, indoor farming. It can be done anywhere, providing fresh local food that is free of pesticides, herbicides and chemical fertilizers. It is safe, easy and fresh!

    Junk food leads to obesity as well as diabetes. In America, people in impoverished communities are not able to afford health care. Therefore, spreading awareness as well as informing people to create an aquaponics system, can promote a healthier life style!</h2>
    <h2>Low Income communities are plagued with various cheap fast food restaurants that could prove detrimental to their health in the long run. Diabetes and other obesity related diseases run rampant in these communities. So creating aquaponics in these communities could introduce a healthy lifestyle in these communities. </h2>

    <button class="button" onclick="changeVisibility()"> <h1> How to get started </h1> </button>
  <div id="hidden_steps">
    <h2><u class="steps">Step 1</u><br>Thoroughly wash the gravel and place in the bottom of the fish tank.
    

</h2>

    <h2><u class="steps">Step 2</u><br>Drill 1/8” or 3/16” holes in the bottom of the grow bed every 2 square inches so the water can drain into the tank. In one of the back corners of the grow bed, drill a 1/2” hole for the tubing from the water pump to pass through.</h2>

    <h2><u class="steps">Step 3</u><br>Place the water pump in the fish tank then set the grow bed on top of the tank. Feed the tubing from the water pump through the 1/2” hole. Leave enough tubing to extend about 3/4 the height of the grow bed and to loop around the inside of the grow bed. Cut off any excess tube and fold the end over. Seal the folded piece with electrical tape.</h2>

    <h2><u class="steps">Step 4</u><br>Fill the grow bed with the growing medium to just under the top of the tube.</h2>

    <h2><u class="steps">Step 5</u><br>Puncture small holes every 2 inches in the section of tubing that loops in the grow bed.

</h2>
    <h2><u class="steps">Step 6</u><br>Cover the loop of tubing with an inch or two of growing medium.

</h2>

    <h2><u class="steps">Step 7</u><br>Fill the fish tank with water. Plug in the pump to ensure that the water is pumped into the grow bed, trickles down through the growing medium and continuously back into the tank. Depending on the size of your tank, grow bed and pump, you may have to adjust the flow.

</h2>

  <h2><u class="steps">Step 8</u><br>Connect you air pump to the air stone with the air tubing. Place the air stone in the tank and plug in the air pump. A steady stream of bubbles should rise through the water, providing fresh air.</h2>

  <h2><u class="steps">Step 9</u><br>Check the pH of your water using litmus paper, a pH test kit or pH meter. Limtmus paper and inexpensive pH test kits are available in most hardware pool supply stores. The ideal pH is 7.0 for an aquaponic system. If it is higher than 7.2 you should lower it with a “pH down” product and if it is lower than 6.8 you should raise it with a “pH up” product, both of which are available from aquarium stores.</h2>

  <h2><u class="steps">Step 10</u><br>Allow the unit to sit for 24 hours to be sure all chlorine has dissipated from the water. If you want to stock your fish right away, you’ll need to add a chlorine remover, which is available from aquarium shops and pet stores.</h2>

  <h2><u class="steps">Step 11</u><br>Add your fish to the fish tank. Initially, you should lightly stock your tank with no more than 1/2” of fish per gallon of water. Once your system has been established for over a month you can increase to fish density to 1” per gallon of water.</h2>

  <h2><u class="steps">Step 12</u><br>Ideally you should wait approximately 4 weeks to add plants to your system, but if you are eager to plant it, add just a few plants or seeds and increase plant density in a month or so when your system is well established.</h2>
